# 4CS

## What is 4CS
4CS is a 4chan.org lurker.


## Features
This is still quite work in progress.


### What can it do ?
It provides "simple" features as
* Watching a Specified Thread or Board for imgs, links or text.
* Commandline interface

### What is Missing ?

* Looking for specific keywords or file extension in a board or thread.
* Download all text, url or images that is to be found on a 4chan thread or board.
* Sorting everything into board specific folders and thread_id specific folders
* set a time for how long it should scrape a board, like 4days, and store all data
* Multithreading EVERYTHING 
* Commandline interface
* clean up the regex expressions
* SCRAPE ALL BOARDS CONCURRENTLY!
* if a board returns a id instead of a text title, the thread is fucking dead 
* if a thread does not return any content it should be skipped, and not printed out, and then in the end it should give summary of like 2threads with urls matching this word and 69 did not.
* setup github acttions to format code ??

### Usage
```bash
pipenv install; pipenv shell

```
